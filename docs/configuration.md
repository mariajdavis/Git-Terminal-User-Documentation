## Basic Terminal Commands

Note: Whenever the <> symbols appear in a command, it is meant to be replaced with your own input.

Change directory:
```bash
cd <path/to/directory/>
```

Move backwards a directory:
```bash
cd ..
```

List contents of directory:
```bash
ls "path/to/directory/" 
```

Open a file:
```bash
open <filename> 
```

Create a directory:
```bash
mkdir <new-directory-name> 
```

## Git Installation

To install Git:

1.  Open the Terminal application
2.  Check to see if git is already installed: 
```bash
git --version
```
3.  If it is not yet installed, you will be prompted to go ahead and install it


Note: You will know when Git has been successfully installed when the ```bashgit --version```	command the following result appears in Terminal: ```bashgit version <latest-version-number> (Apple Git-<version-number>)```

## Initialize Account
