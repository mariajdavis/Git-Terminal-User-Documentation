# How to Use Git on Terminal

User documentation for Git on Terminal.

## About

Instructions for setting up Git, managing Git repositories, and collaborating with other users, all through Mac's Terminal interface.

## Purpose

This instruction set is designed to teach users the basics of Git on Terminal.

## Audience

First time Mac users of Git on Terminal and users with not much familiarity with Terminal commands.

## Structure

Since the instructions are for first time users, we have focused on three separate groups of instructions:

1. Getting Started: installation, account set up, Git configuration
2. Repositories: how to create and update local and remote repositories
3. Collaboration: how to use branching to collaborate remotely

## Process

Our team began this project by deciding to focus on Git using Terminal, both applications that we found to be fundamental to computing, particularly for Mac users like ourselves. In all of our classes at BCIT, we have been encouraged to use Git through the command line and we know that employers are also looking for this skill. Once we decided on our topic, we then decided on three sections to focus on for first time users of Git on Terminal. We agreed that set up should be first, then an introduction to creating and managing repositories, followed by a introduction to using Git to work collaboratively. We wrote our documentation in a text editor and once we were pleased with the content and its readability we moved it to GitHub. We are confident that it will help first time users because when starting out this project, neither of us were very familiar with Git on Terminal.
