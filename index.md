## Purpose

This documentation will introduce users to the basic commands they will need to know to set up Git on their computer, create and manage their own Git repository, and use Git to collaborate with others.

## Intended Audience

This user documentation series is meant for first time users of Git on the built-in Terminal interface of Mac operating systems.

## Introduction to Git

Git is a popular version-control system used in software development. Version-control allows  developers to track changes in source code throughout development. It also enables collaboration between developers working remotely. 

## Introduction to Terminal

Terminal is the built-in command-line interface on Mac operating systems. A command-line interface processes text commands to the computer. One way to use Git is through the command line. While there are now different graphical user interfaces that allow you to utilize Git without using Terminal, like GitHub Desktop, there are certain Git commands that can only be executed on the command line. Many employers expect developers to be comfortable working on the command line.

## Prerequisites

These instructions assume that users are already familiar with their Mac operating systems and can access the Terminal interface. It will also assume that a user can prepare their own project files to store on Git.

To follow these instructions, you will need:

* A computer with a Mac operating system (latest version preferred)
* A functional keyboard

## Typographic Conventions

The typographic conventions of our instruction set are listed here:

| Type | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Terminal input appears inside a box | ```git add``` |
| Terminal input to be customized will be inside the <> symbols | ```open <file-name>``` |

## Notes

Pay special attention to the following icon when it appears in our instructions:

## About the Project

The project was originally designed to help fellow computer science students with the basics of Git on Mac's Terminal interface.
