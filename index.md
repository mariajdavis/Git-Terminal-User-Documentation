# How to Use Git on Terminal
{: .fs-9 }

User documentation for Git on Mac's Terminal
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Purpose

This user documentation series is meant for first time users of Git on the built-in Terminal interface of Mac operating systems. This documentation will introduce users to the basic commands they will need to know to set up Git on their computer, create and manage their own Git repository, and use Git to collaborate with others.

## Introduction to Git

Git is a popular version-control system used in software development. Version-control allows  developers to track changes in source code throughout development. It also enables collaboration between developers working remotely. 

## Introduction to Terminal

Terminal is the built-in command-line interface on Mac operating systems. A command-line interface processes text commands to the computer. One way to use Git is through the command line. While there are now different graphical user interfaces that allow you to utilize Git without using Terminal, like GitHub Desktop, there are certain Git commands that can only be executed on the command line. Many employers expect developers to be comfortable working on the command line.

## Assumptions

These instructions assume that users are already familiar with their Mac operating systems and can access the Terminal interface. It will also assume that a user can prepare their own project files to store on Git.
